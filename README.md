## About
The Origin: Mr. "The Banker" B. sent R. Neff a copy of this, years ago.
We believe this was sent as a friendly gesture, 
however this has been evilishly adopted as a aircraft carrier to house the AI which destroys Milkyway core systems.

This is being updated to allow **a few**, *video game developers*, a way of **easily implementing real time adaptation and AI analysis** to *enhance* behavior of automated bots within __Unreal Engine 4__ and beyond into the eternal future.

This is just the platform, not the finished version for that project. This will remain clean cut and **AVAILABLE ON GITHUB AT ALL TIMES**.

We are looking for a Python master to handle all adaptive programming and analysis, as well as algo development to process AI reactions to incoming fire, or supression, and succession of command during firefights.

__For the game-dev version__, please visit www.DEVGRU.club and click "Enhanced AI Interfacing"

Included is 0 wisdom and a Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml

**Currently Working To Enhance Mr B's Previous Dockerfile Setup**
